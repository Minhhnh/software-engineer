# Software Engineer

A curated, high-quality collection of learning resources focused on **Python** and soon **C/C++**, designed to build strong software engineering foundations and system-level understanding.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```text
.
├── docs/                   # High-performance computing, GPU, and system-level insights
├── python-basic/           # Essential Python data types and syntax
├── python-advanced/        # Deeper Python topics and standard libraries
├── python-OOP/             # Object-Oriented Programming in Python — beginner to advanced
└── README.md               # Project overview (this file)
```

## 🚀 How to Use

Each numbered folder contains a `README.md` explaining the concepts, along with runnable `.py` files. For example:

```bash
cd python-advanced/08-decorators
python basic_function_decorator.py
```

Some scripts require third-party libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `torch`).

All code is compatible with **Python 3.7+** and written to be **minimal, focused, and testable**.

## 📘 Highlights

- **OOP Mastery**: From basic classes to metaclasses and descriptors (`python-OOP`)
- **Advanced Python**: Covers generators, decorators, `itertools`, JSON, threading, context managers
- **HPC & GPU Programming**: Deep-dive into performance, GIL, CUDA cores, memory, and Python-C++ interop (`docs/`)

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

- ✅ Small, modular examples — no cluttered notebooks
- ✅ Clear separation between concept, code, and commentary
- ✅ Emphasis on design, performance, and maintainability
- ✅ Builds knowledge progressively — ideal for serious learners and professionals

## 🔧 Upcoming Work

Future modules will include:

- **C/C++ for Pythonists**: Deep dive into system-level design, memory, and cross-language integration
- **Compiler Internals & Optimization**
- **Concurrency and Parallelism with Native Threads and MPI**

Stay tuned!
