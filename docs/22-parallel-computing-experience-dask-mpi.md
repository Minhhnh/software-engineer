# Do you have experience with parallel computing frameworks or libraries (e.g. MPI, Dask)?

Yes, I have experience with **parallel computing frameworks** and tools like **Dask**, and I understand the design and usage of **MPI-based frameworks** such as `mpi4py`. Here's how I would approach this question:

### My Experience with Parallel Computing

#### ðŸ”¹ **Dask**

- Used **Dask** to parallelize NumPy and Pandas workflows on **multi-core CPUs** and **clusters**.
- Experience includes:

  - Using `dask.array` and `dask.dataframe` for out-of-core computation
  - Scheduling distributed tasks across a **local thread/process pool** or **remote Dask cluster**
  - Profiling Dask workloads with its dashboard to optimize task graph execution

#### ðŸ”¹ **MPI Concepts (via `mpi4py`)**

- Familiar with **message-passing** parallelism (used in HPC).
- Used **`mpi4py`** for:

  - Explicit communication between Python processes (e.g., `Send`, `Recv`, `Scatter`, `Gather`)
  - Coordinating large-scale parallel jobs across compute nodes

- Understand how MPI enables **distributed memory parallelism**, in contrast to shared memory models.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Multiprocessing and Threading in Python**

- Used Pythonâ€™s `multiprocessing` module to:

  - Parallelize CPU-bound tasks
  - Avoid GIL limitations using **processes instead of threads**

- Used `concurrent.futures`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and `ProcessPoolExecutor` for task-based parallelism

### ðŸ§  Broader Concepts I Understand

| Concept                          | Description                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared vs Distributed Memory** | Threads share memory; MPI-based processes do not                                               |
| **GIL Limitation**               | Threads in CPython are limited; prefer `multiprocessing` or native code                        |
| **Task Scheduling**              | Dask schedules large DAGs of tasks efficiently across compute resources                        |
| **GPU Parallelism**              | Experience using **multi-GPU** setups with PyTorch and **NCCL**                                |
| **Scalability**                  | MPI is ideal for **tightly-coupled HPC**, while Dask suits **data analytics and ML** pipelines |

### Summary:

> Iâ€™ve used both **Dask for task-based parallelism** and **MPI for explicit process coordination**, and Iâ€™m comfortable with **threading, multiprocessing, and distributed computing** concepts. I understand how to choose between frameworks depending on whether the workload is CPU-bound, I/O-bound, or distributed across machines.
