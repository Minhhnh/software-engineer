# 02 - Class vs. Instance Attributes in Python

This chapter explores the distinction between **class attributes**, **instance attributes**, and the use of **static** and **class methods** in Python's object-oriented programming model.

## Key Concepts

### Class Attribute

- Shared across all instances.
- Defined directly in the class body.

### Instance Attribute

- Unique to each object.
- Defined within `__init__`.

### Static Method

- Doesnâ€™t access class or instance data.
- Use for utility functions tied to a class context.

### Class Method

- Takes `cls` as the first parameter.
- Can access class state; useful in inheritance and factory patterns.

## Learning Tip

- Use class attributes for global counters or shared constants.
- Use instance attributes to track data specific to each object.
- Prefer class methods when functionality must vary across subclasses.
