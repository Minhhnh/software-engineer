# 10. Inheritance

Inheritance is a key feature of object-oriented programming that allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It supports code reuse and models real-world hierarchical relationships.

## Key Concepts

- **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from one parent class.
- **Method Overriding**: A subclass redefines a method from its superclass.
- **`super()` Function**: Calls a method from the parent class.
- **`isinstance()` vs `type()`**: Use `isinstance()` to check inheritance chains.
- **Overwriting vs Overriding vs Overloading**: Explained with examples.

## Examples

| File                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `basic_inheritance.py`  | Shows simple inheritance of methods.                         |
| `override_and_super.py` | Demonstrates method overriding and use of `super()`.         |
| `doctor_robot.py`       | Applies inheritance in a real-world example (healing robot). |
| `type_vs_isinstance.py` | Highlights difference between `type()` and `isinstance()`.   |
| `animal_hierarchy.py`   | Exercise 1: Inheritance in an animal class hierarchy.        |
| `shape_hierarchy.py`    | Exercise 2: Inheritance in geometric shape classes.          |

## Exercises

1. Build a class hierarchy of animals (Mammal, Bird, Reptile).
2. Create a shape system (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) using inheritance.

Run the Python files individually to see behavior and output.
