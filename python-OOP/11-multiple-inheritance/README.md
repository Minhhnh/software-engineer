# 11. Multiple Inheritance

This lesson covers **multiple inheritance** in Python, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports this with a well-designed Method Resolution Order (MRO) mechanism.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- What is multiple inheritance?
- The diamond problem
- Using `super()` and MRO
- CalendarClock example combining `Clock` and `Calendar`
- HybridCar example
- Polymorphism demonstration

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

- Understand how multiple inheritance works in Python.
- Learn about ambiguity in inheritance (diamond problem).
- Apply `super()` to resolve method conflicts cleanly.
- Combine behavior from multiple classes effectively.
