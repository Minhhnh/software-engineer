# 12. Multiple Inheritance in Python

This section of our Python OOP tutorial focuses on **Multiple Inheritance**, building on our understanding from single inheritance. We use an extended example involving different types of robots to explore key OOP principles in Python, including:

- Inheritance and class hierarchies
- Overriding methods
- Type-dependent instantiation (`type(self)`)
- Use of `super()` and `**kwargs` for cooperative multiple inheritance

## Structure

### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:

- Base class: `Robot`
- Derived classes: `NursingRobot`, `FightingRobot`
- Multiple inheritance: `FightingNurseRobot`
- Flexible constructors with `**kwargs`: `FightingHealingRobot`

### ðŸš€ How to Run

Each `.py` file contains standalone runnable code. You can execute them directly:

```bash
python robot_base.py
python nursing_robot.py
python fighting_robot.py
python fighting_nurse_robot.py
python advanced_fighting_healing_robot.py
```
