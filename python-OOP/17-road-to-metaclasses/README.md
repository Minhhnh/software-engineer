# 17. Road to Metaclasses

This tutorial explores the concepts and practices that pave the way to understanding Python metaclasses. While not directly implementing metaclasses, we build a foundation by exploring **class decoration**, **runtime augmentation**, and **dynamic behavior injection** into classes.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents

### 1. Manual Inheritance

Demonstrates a naive implementation of duplicated logic across multiple classes and how inheritance solves it using a base class.

### 2. Runtime Method Injection

Introduces the concept of dynamically injecting a method into classes based on a runtime condition.

### 3. Manager Function

Encapsulates augmentation logic inside a function to reduce repetition and error-prone logic.

### 4. Class Decorator

Demonstrates how decorators can cleanly and automatically apply changes to class definitions at runtime.

### 5. Realistic Class Decorator

Shows how to create parameterized class decorators that dynamically add class-level attributes.
