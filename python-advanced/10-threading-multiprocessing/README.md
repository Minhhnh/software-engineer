# üßµ Threading vs Multiprocessing in Python

This module demonstrates the practical differences between **threading** and **multiprocessing** in Python ‚Äî two powerful tools for concurrency and parallelism. It explains:

- When to use threads (I/O-bound tasks)
- When to use processes (CPU-bound tasks)
- Python‚Äôs Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its impact
- Practical memory and performance considerations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Differences

| Aspect            | Threading                           | Multiprocessing                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Execution Unit    | Thread (lightweight)                | Process (independent)                   |
| Memory Sharing    | Shared memory space                 | Separate memory space                   |
| GIL Effect        | Shared GIL ‚Üí limited parallelism    | One GIL per process ‚Üí real parallelism  |
| Start-up Time     | Fast                                | Slower                                  |
| Best for          | I/O-bound tasks (e.g., networking)  | CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computation)     |
| Failure Isolation | Threads can crash the whole process | Process isolation; safer error handling |
